"'A range-break from Bitcoin could trigger buying in ADA, ATOM, FIL and EOS this week'","Sun, 04 Sep 2022 21:30:38 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-range-break-from-bitcoin-could-trigger-buying-in-ada-atom-fil-and-eos-this-week,"'If BTC bounces from its key underlying support, ADA, ATOM, FIL and EOS could break out.'","The decline in the United States equities markets last week extended the market-wide losing streak to three consecutive weeks. The Nasdaq Composite fell for six days in a row for the first time since 2019. The markets negative reaction to a seemingly positive August jobs report suggests that traders are nervous about the Federal Reserve’s future steps and its effects on the economy.Weakness in the U.S. equities markets pulled Bitcoin (BTC) back below $20,000 on Sept. 2 and bears sustained the price below the level during the weekend. This pulled Bitcoin’s market dominance to just under 39% on Sept. 4, its lowest level since June 2018, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Although the sentiment remains negative and it is difficult to call a bottom, investors who believe in the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies could take the opportunity to gradually build positions at lower levels instead of trying to catch the bottom. However, investors could avoid chasing prices higher during bear market rallies and look to buy when the price falls to strong support levels. If Bitcoin stages a recovery, select altcoins could move higher. Let’s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that are looking strong on the charts.

Although bulls are buying on dips, they have failed to overcome the selling at higher levels.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($20,863) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers. If bears sink the price below $19,520, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the strong support zone between $18,910 and $18,626. This zone is likely to attract strong buying by the bulls as that has been the case on two previous occasions. The bears will have to sink the price below $17,622 to signal the resumption of the downtrend.On the other hand, buyers will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to indicate that the bears may be losing their grip. The pair could then rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($22,271).BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe price rebounded off the strong support near $19,520 but the bears are attempting to stall the recovery at the moving averages. This shows that bears are selling on every minor rally. If bears sink the price below $19,520, the pair could resume the next leg of the downtrend.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls thrust the price above the moving averages, the pair could attempt a rally to the resistance of the range at $20,576. Buyers will have to clear this hurdle to signal a potential trend change in the near term.ADA/USDTCardano (ADA) is in a consolidation but it is attempting to rise above the moving averages. This indicates demand at lower levels and increases the chances of an up-move, which is the reason for its selection.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.47) has flattened out and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.50), the ADA/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. This level could again act as a strong resistance but if bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could rally to $0.70.This positive view could be negated in the short term if the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could again slide to the strong support at $0.40.ADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is sloping up and the RSI has risen into the overbought territory. This indicates that bulls are in command but a minor correction or consolidation is possible in the near term. If buyers sustain the price above $0.48 or the 20-EMA, it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That could push the price to $0.54 and later to the downtrend line.To invalidate this positive view, bears will have to pull the price below $0.48. If that happens, the pair could slide to $0.44 and then to $0.42.ATOM/USDTCosmos (ATOM) has not given up ground in the past few days and is trading near its overhead resistance at $13.45. This indicates that traders are not closing their positions as they anticipate the price to move higher. This is the reason for its inclusion in this list.ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe ATOM/USDT pair dipped below the 50-day SMA ($11.08) on Aug. 29 but the bulls purchased at lower levels. That started a rebound which reached the overhead resistance at $13.45. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.If buyers propel the price above $13.45, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $15.30 and then to $20. This positive view could invalidate if the price turns down sharply and plummets below the psychological support at $10.ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-EMA is sloping up and the bulls are buying the dips to this support. This suggests a positive sentiment in the short term. The bulls will attempt to push the price to the overhead resistance at $13.45. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break and close above it could indicate the resumption of the up-move.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. The pair may then remain range-bound between $10 and $13.45 for some time. Related: Surge or purge? Why the Merge may not save Ethereum price from 'Septembear'FIL/USDTFilecoin (FIL) had been trading in a tight range between Aug. 27 and Sept. 2, which resolved to the upside on Sept. 3. An expectation that buyers may continue their purchases led to the selection of this coin.FIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe FIL/USDT pair turned up sharply and broke above the 20-day EMA ($6.39) on Sept. 3. This is the first indication that buyers are attempting a comeback. However, the bears are unlikely to surrender easily and they are posing a strong challenge near the 50-day SMA ($6.92).The bears pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA on Sept. 4. If they sustain the price below this level, the pair could decline to $5.50. Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will suggest strong buying on dips. The pair could then rally to $9 and thereafter to $9.50.FIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe pair turned down from the overhead resistance zone between $6.80 and $6.60 but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the current level, the possibility of a break and close above the zone increases. If that happens, the pair will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally toward the pattern target of $7.6 and later to $8.30.This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price breaks and closes below the 20-EMA. The pair could then drop to the strong support at $5.50.EOS/USDTEOS has made it to the list because even in the mayhem, it has managed to stay above the moving averages. This indicates short-term outperformance and increases the likelihood of a rally if the sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector improves. EOS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe EOS/USDT pair completed a rounding bottom pattern on Aug. 21 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The bears pulled the price back below the breakout level on Aug. 28, indicating strong selling on rallies.A minor positive is that the buyers aggressively purchased the drop to the 50-day SMA ($1.33). The 20-day EMA ($1.48) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers.This balance could tilt in favor of the bulls if they push and sustain the price above $1.60. The pair could then rally to the overhead resistance near $2. Alternatively, a break and close below the 50-day SMA could open the doors for a possible drop to $1.15. EOS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears sold the rebound near $1.60 and are attempting to pull the price back below the breakout level of $1.46. If they do that, the pair could decline to the uptrend line. This level has acted as a strong support on three previous occasions, hence the bulls will again try to defend it.If the price rebounds off the uptrend line and breaks above $1.60, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $1.80 and later to $2. Conversely, a break and close below the uptrend line will suggest that the short-term up-move could be over. The pair could then decline to $1.24.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

'Repurposing Bitcoin mining heat can solve global energy crisis: Arcane',"Sun, 04 Sep 2022 07:03:08 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/repurposing-bitcoin-mining-heat-can-solve-global-energy-crisis-arcane,"'While innovations in chipset manufacturing have helped reduce operational costs related to Bitcoin mining, a report from Arcane reveals the market’s potential to transform the energy industry.'","The flexibility behind running Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations can be vital to solving the real-world problems that stand in the way of the energy industry, suggests Arcane research.One of the biggest concerns authorities raise when it comes to Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption is its energy requirements. While innovations in chipset manufacturing have helped reduce operational costs related to Bitcoin mining, a report from Arcane reveals the market’s potential to transform the energy industry. Owing to low cost of reacting, Bitcoin mining complements the growth of wind and solar grids, which often produce unstable and non-controllable energy. Arcane research points out that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, to date, has only allowed bitcoin miners to participate in the most advanced demand response programs.In addition to being flexible to grid demands, Bitcoin mining can also help solve issues related to gas flaring — the process of burning natural gas associated with oil extraction. Arcane highlights that by leveraging the agnosticism, modularity, and portability of Bitcoin rigs, miners can setup operations next to oil wells, reasoning that “Per $1,000 investment, a bitcoin mining system reduces emissions of 6.32 tons of CO2 equivalents per year, compared to 1.3 for wind and 0.98 for solar.”Bitcoin mining can further help the energy industry by repurposing its byproduct — heat — to heat up homes, industries, and other applications during the coming winter. It is important to note that heating accounts for roughly 40% of the world's CO2 emissions.Repurposing heat from Bitcoin mining offers various advantages, including operational subsidies and lower heating costs.Related: US lawmakers appeal directly to 4 mining firms, requesting info on energy consumptionThe importance of the above research comes at a time when Eurozone hit record inflation of 9.1% amid gas and energy crisis. As Cointelegraph reported, energy prices made up the largest price push, up by an annual rate of 38.3% over the past month.

Later on, they also suggested that BTC would never fall under $20,000. Of course, “now” is a great time to buy the dip, and one would think that buying BTC at or under $10,000 would also be the purchase of a lifetime. But by now, all the so-called “experts'' have fallen quiet and are nowhere to be seen or heard. So, investors are left to their own devices and thoughts to contemplate whether or not the bottom is in. Should one be patient and wait for the forecast “drop to $10,000” or is now the time to buy Bitcoin and altcoins?Generally, calling price bottoms is a futile task. What's really important to focus on is whether or not there are fundamental reasons for choosing to or not to invest in Bitcoin. Sure, price has changed drastically, but have Bitcoin’s network fundamentals and the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin as an asset improved or degraded? It’s important to zoom in on this data because for investors, this is where one should be sourcing their confidence and investment thesis. This is exactly why Cointelegraph hosted a Twitter Spaces with analysts Joe Burnett of Blockware Solutions and Colin Harper of Luxor Mining. Here’s a few highlights from the conversation.Equities markets will decide when Bitcoin price can “go back up” According to Blockware Solutions analyst Joe Burnett, Bitcoin price is heavily impacted by Federal Reserve policy and its impact on equities markets. Burnett said: “The macro environment is obviously heavily weighing on the price of Bitcoin. High CPI inflation has led to an aggressive Fed since November of 2021. Higher interest rates inevitably cause all assets to come down. Interest rates are basically gravity on financial assets, just basically discounted cash flow analysis. And these increasing interest rates are an attempt to destroy demand and and destroy inflation by the Fed. It's obviously putting pressure on all risk assets, including Bitcoin.” When asked about the Bitcoin hash ribbons on-chain indicator suggesting that BTC had bottomed and miners had capitulated confirming that the Bitcoin bottom was in, Burnett said “I think with every sort of like on chain type metric, you definitely have to take it with a grain of salt. You can't look at it in a vacuum and say, yes, the bitcoin bottom is in.” Burnett said: “If US equities do make new lows, I certainly expect Bitcoin to follow. With that being said, I mean, if you're looking at the fundamentals of Bitcoin itself, I think minor capitulations do typically mark Bitcoin bottoms. And a hash driven indicator that Charles Edwards created is basically depicting that there was a miner capitulation this summer.”Related: Canaan exec says opportunity outweighs crisis as Bitcoin miners struggle with shrinking profitsSynergy between Big Energy and Bitcoin miners is a net positive for BTCDiscussion of the growing partnership between big energy providers, oil and gas companies and industrial-size Bitcoin miners has been a hot topic throughout 2022, and when asked about the direct benefits of this relationship to Bitcoin itself, Colin Harper said:“I don't think that mining does anything bad or good for Bitcoin. I think it's good for Bitcoin in the sense that it will actually in the long run strengthen network security, decentralize mining and put it in like basically every corner of the globe if you have energy producers mining it. But in terms of actually doing anything to the price, I think that's just a kind of a wider adoption case. And as to whether or not people will be using it day to day as a medium of exchange, store of value and just general investment.”Harper elaborated with, “If these companies do start mining it, then it becomes more palatable. It becomes less stigmatized. Depending on, I guess the oil producer and that person's politics.” When asked about what Bitcoin mass adoption might look like in the future, in relation to the growth of the mining industry, Harper explained that: “It's just going to be a matter of time before they start integrating Bitcoin into their stacks. And I think that's when things get interesting in terms of mining as an industry because if you have the producers of the energy and the people who own the energy mining Bitcoin, then that makes it very hard for people without those assets to eventually turn a profit because you're going to see hash price, which already trades in backwardation. Eventually, you can imagine a future where only energy producers and those who are invested with or embedded with energy producers can actually turn a profit on their bitcoin mining.”Regulation and a growing desire to self-custody will drive Bitcoin Lightning Network growthBoth analysts agreed that while it may take a handful of years, the growth potential for layer-2 Bitcoin is bright. Burnett predicted that “over time more and more people will learn to demand final settlement of their Bitcoin, meaning that more people will hold their own keys.” According to Burnett: “If Bitcoin adoption grows by 100x or 1000x, there's going to be a lot more competition for scarce block space and on-chain fees will likely rise just because people will be demanding much more settlement, magnitudes more settlement on the base layer. But the block space to settle on the base layer is fixed. So these on chain fees rising will basically, in my opinion, potentially make lightning channel liquidity that's already open and available. It'll make it more valuable.”Harper wholeheartedly agreed and added that, in his opinion, the Lightning Network “will be the thing that allows Bitcoin to be used as a worldwide medium of exchange and also, like Jack Mallers has put it, It's the thing that can kind of separate Bitcoin, the asset from Bitcoin, the payment network in a way that's actually scalable.” Tune in here to listen to the full conversation of the Twitter Space.

"""Surge or purge? Why the Merge may not save Ethereum price from 'Septembear'""","Sat, 03 Sep 2022 15:22:04 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/surge-or-purge-why-the-merge-may-not-save-ethereum-price-from-septembear,"'Options data, macroeconomic catalysts and technical signals suggest a decline in Ethereum price is on the table despite the Merge.'","Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is not immune to downside risk in September after rallying approximately 90% from its bottom of around $880 in June. Much of the token's upside move is attributed to the Merge, a technical upgrade that would make Ethereum a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, slated for Sep. 15.But despite logging impressive gains between June and September, Ether still trades almost 70% below its record high of around $4,950 from November 2021. Therefore, its possibility of heading lower remains on the cards.ETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewHere are three Ethereum bearish market indicators that show why more downside is likely. Sell the Ethereum Merge newsEthereum options traders anticipate Ether's price to reach $2,200 from its current $1,540 level ahead of the Merge, according to Deribit data compiled by Glassnode. Some even see the price hitting $5,000, but enthusiasm looks flat post the PoS switch.There appears to be demand for downside protection among traders after the Merge, indicated by a so-called ""options implied volatility smile"" metric (OIVS).OIVS illustrates the options' implied volatilities with different strikes for the specific expiration date. So, contracts out of capital typically show higher implied volatility, and vice versa.For instance, in the Ethereum's Sept. 30 options expiry chart below, the smile's steepness and shape help traders assess the relative expensiveness of options and gauge what kind of tail risks the market is pricing in.Ethereum OIVS for the contract expiring on Sept. 30, 2022. Source: GlassnodeThus, it shows a large buy-side demand for ETH call options expiring in September, indicated by the volatility smile's upward slope, showing traders are willing to pay a premium for a long exposure.“Post Merge, the left tail is pricing in significantly higher implied volatility, indicating traders are paying a premium for ‘sell-the-news’ put-option protection post-Merge,” Glassnode analysts wrote, citing the OIVS chart below that also features Call and Put open interests at different strike rates.Ethereum OIVS for the contract expiring on Oct. 28, 2022. Source: GlassnodeIn other words, ETH traders are hedging their bets in case of a sell-the-news event. Hawkish Federal ReserveMore downside cues from Ethereum come from its exposure to macroeconomic events, mainly quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve.Last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to curbing inflation, noting they ""must keep at it until the job is done."" In other words, Powell and his associates would likely raise interest rates by 0.5%-0.75% in their next policy meeting in September.Rate hikes have recently been bad news for the ETH/USD pair, given the growing positive correlation between a broader crypto sector and traditional risk-on indices against the prospects of declining cash liquidity. For instance, the daily correlation coefficient between ETH and Nasdaq as of Sep. 3 was 0.85.ETH/USD and Nasdaq daily correlation coefficient. Source: TradingViewTherefore, the possibility of Ether declining alongside riskier assets is high, particularly if the Fed hikes by 0.75%.That giant Ether ""bear flag""From a technical perspective, Ether is painting what appears like a bear flag on its weekly chart.Bear flags appear when the price consolidates higher inside an ascending parallel channel after a strong move downward. They resolve after the price breaks out of the channel to the downside and, as a rule of technical analysis, falls by as much as the previous downtrend's length (flagpole).Ether tested the bear flag's lower trendline as support this week. From here, the Ethereum token could either rebound to retest the flag's upper trendline (~$2,500) as resistance or break below the lower trendline to continue its prevailing bearish trend.Related: ETH price outlook for The Merge: Bullish or bearish? | TheChartGuys interviewGiven the factors discussed above, the ETH/USD pair risks entering the bear flag breakdown stage in September, as illustrated in the chart below.ETH/USD weekly price chart featuring 'bear flag' setup.

While investigations were underway, KyberSwap offered a 10% bounty — of roughly $40,000 — to the hacker as means to remediate the situation.Parallelly, based on an independent investigation, Binance’s security team identified two suspects that may be responsible for orchestrating the virtual heist. Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao confirmed that the intel had been sent to the Kyber team. 

Binance has also begun coordinating with law enforcement as efforts from both ends continue to corner the hackers.Being the biggest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume, Binance’s proactive and selfless effort to help investors from other ecosystems didn't go unnoticed, as one of the community members pointed out:“Binance is now playing the role of a big brother in the crypto space. Binance has gone beyond securing its platform to securing the entire crypto ecosystem.”If Binance’s investigation checks out, KyberSwap investors may be witness to a rare community-driven hack redemption.Related: Binance froze $1M corporate account due to law enforcement requestCZ recently retaliated against rumors and false allegations that Binance was a Chinese-based “criminal entity” that “secretly [belongs] in the pocket of the Chinese government.”While explaining his long-time ties to Chinese entrepreneurs and colleagues, he added: “The greatest challenge that Binance faces today is that we (and every other offshore exchange) have been designated a criminal entity in China. At the same time, our opposition in the west bends over backward to paint us as a ‘Chinese company.’”CZ confirmed that Binance has never been legally incorporated in China and never operated like a Chinese company culturally either.

"""Crypto's adaptability, openness key to ideal monetary system, say BIS execs""","Sat, 03 Sep 2022 06:45:49 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-s-adaptability-openness-key-to-ideal-monetary-system-say-bis-execs,"'Some of the biggest flaws preventing present-day cryptocurrencies from mainstream adoption, pointed out by the BIS execs, are bottleneck congestion in DeFi and the reliance on volatile assets.'","Governments across the globe see central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as a means to improve the existing fiat ecosystem. Cryptocurrency’s technical prowess supported by the central bank’s underlying trust is key to enabling a rich monetary ecosystem, suggests an International Monetary Fund (IMF) publication. “Digital technologies promise a bright future for the monetary system,” reads the publication attributed to IMF deputy managing director Agustín Carstens and BIS executives Jon Frost and Hyun Song Shin. A BIS study from June revealed that cryptocurrencies outdo fiat ecosystems when it comes to achieving the high-level goals of a future monetary system.Some of the most significant flaws preventing present-day cryptocurrencies from mainstream adoption, pointed out by the BIS execs, are bottleneck congestion in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the reliance on volatile assets.Both wholesale and retail CBDCs can potentially inherit abilities from the crypto ecosystem that benefit end users, the post highlighted:“By embracing the core of trust provided by central bank money, the private sector can adopt the best new technologies to foster a rich and diverse monetary ecosystem.”It further recommended central banks utilize innovations such as tokenization to allow purchases using multiple fiat currencies — further benefiting merchants and customers.Related: India cooperates with IMF on crypto consultation paperThe IMF’s gloomy forecast predicting a global economic slowdown raised concerns about an incoming recession in the crypto markets. Cointelegraph previously reported that Bitcoin (BTC) markets were likely to recover when the uncertainty about the current state of the economy and geopolitical tensions are resolved.However, the IMF pointed out that the various liquidations, bankruptcies and losses at major firms like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital Holdings had only a minor impact on traditional financial systems.

'3 ways to trade Bitcoin and altcoins during a bear market',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 22:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-ways-to-trade-bitcoin-and-altcoins-during-a-bear-market,"'Everyone’s a genius during a bull market, but how should one trade in a bear market?'","Markets are scary right now, and while the situation is likely to worsen, it doesn’t mean investors need to sit out and watch from the sidelines. In fact, history has proven that one of the best times to buy Bitcoin (BTC) is when no one is talking about Bitcoin.Remember the 2018–2020 crypto winter? I do. Hardly anyone, including mainstream media, was talking about crypto in a positive or negative way. It was during this time of prolonged downtrend and lengthy sideways chop that smart investors were accumulating in preparation for the next bull trend. Of course, nobody knew “when” this parabolic advance would take place, but the example is purely meant to illustrate that crypto might be in a crab market, but there are still great strategies for investing in Bitcoin. Let’s take a look at three. Accumulation via dollar-cost averagingIt’s helpful to be price agnostic when it comes to investing in assets over the long term. A price agnostic investor is immune to fluctuations in value and will identify a few assets that they believe in and continue to add to the positions. If the project has good fundamentals, a strong, active use case and a healthy network, it makes more sense to just dollar-cost average (DCA) into a position.Take, for example, this chart from DCA.BTC. Results of weekly dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin. Source: DCA.BTCInvestors who auto-purchased $50 in BTC weekly over a two-year span are still in profit today, and by DCA, there is no need to make trades, watch charts, or subject oneself to the emotional stress that is associated with trading. Trade the trend and go long off extreme lowsAside from steady, reasonably sized dollar-cost averaging, investors should be building a war chest of dry powder and just sitting on their hands waiting for generational buying opportunities. Entering the market when it’s deeply oversold and all metrics are in extreme is typically a good place to open spot longs but with less than 20% of one’s dry powder. When assets and price indicators are two or more standard deviations away from the norm, it’s time to start looking around. Some traders zoom out to a three-day or weekly time frame to see when assets correct to higher time frame support levels or previous all-time highs as a sign to invest. 200-week moving average heatmap for Bitcoin. Source: LookIntoBitcoinOthers look for price to flip key moving averages like the 118 DMA, 200 WMA and 200 DMA back to support. On-chain fanatics typically follow the Puell Multiple, MVRV Score, Bitcoin Pi indicator or Realized Price indicator to see when extreme multi-year lows are hit as a sign of when to buy. Either way, opening spot longs during extreme sell-offs usually turns out to be a good swing trade or even entry point for a multi-year-long position. Related: Wen moon? Probably not soon: Why Bitcoin traders should make friends with the trendDo nothing, until the trend changesTrading during a bear market is hard, and capital and portfolio preservation are the top priorities. For this reason, it’s best for some investors to just wait for confirmation of a trend change. As the saying goes, “the trend is your friend.” Everyone is a genius and a superb trader during a bull market, so if that was you, then wait for the next bull trend to roll around and go be a happy-go-lucky genius then. Downtrends, consolidation and bear markets are notorious for chopping up traders and reducing one’s portfolio size, so it’s unwise to trade against the trend unless one has a PNL positive method for trading during bear trends and some skill at shorting. For crypto investors, it’s important not to live in a vacuum and keep an eye on the equities markets. Crypto traders have a tendency to only focus on crypto markets, and this is a mistake because equities markets and BTC and Ether (ETH) prices have shown a strong correlation in the past two years. In one’s charting suite of choice, it would be wise to keep the S&P 500, Dow Jones or Nasdaq charts up alongside BTC’s or ETH’s daily chart. Bitcoin correlation to equities markets. Source: TheBlockIn the most recent trend reversal, BTC’s price action was the canary in the coal mine that began to chirp louder and louder as the United States Federal Reserve amplified its intent to raise interest rates. It is easy to be misled by the minuscule moves that occur in Bitcoin’s four-hour and daily price charts, and one could easily be lured into some hefty positions based on the belief that BTC is on the verge of a reversal. Keeping an eye on the market structure and price action of the largest equities indexes will provide crucial insight into the strength and duration of any bullish or bearish trend that Bitcoin might exhibit.

"'Sept. 22 is the date for Cardano’s Vasil hard fork launch, 3 months after target date'","Fri, 02 Sep 2022 22:15:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/sept-22-is-the-date-for-cardano-s-vasil-hard-fork-launch-3-months-after-target-date,"'The latest upgrade, which is the blockchain’s fifth, will include improvements to the Plutus programming language and promises greater scalability for lower fees.'","Cardano has set September 22 as the date for its Vasil mainnet upgrade, founder of the blockchain Charles Hoskinson announced on his YouTube vlog Friday. The hard fork was originally scheduled for June of this year and rescheduled twice.According to Cardano-associated R&D company Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), which worked on the update, three necessary critical mass indicators have been reached: “1. 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the final Vasil node candidate (1.35.3)  2. approximately 25 exchanges upgraded (representing 80% of ada liquidity)  3. top 10 DApps by TVL confirming they have upgraded to 1.35.3 on PreProduction and are ready for mainnet.” IOHK wrote that, of the top 12 crypto exchanges, MEXC and Bitrue are “ready” for the upgrade, while Binance is “nearly there” and Upbit, Coinbase, WhiteBit, BKEX and HitBTC are “in progress.”

Developers have promised greater scalability and lower fees from the hard fork, which will incorporate the first major upgrade to the Plutus script — the programming language used for smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. Plutus was introduced in the previous upgrade, named Alonzo, which took place in September of last year.Related: Cardano gets listed on Robinhood but ADA bulls are running out of steam, risking 40% drop“If we’ve all done our job right, we will wake up on Sept. 22, and it will be just another day,” Hoskinson said on his YouTube vlog. Later he added:“We started and knew that, over time, we could get to what Ethereum has done, but we understood a road map to get there. […] There’s a lot of things on the horizon, especially in 2023.”The fork is named in honor of Vasil Dabov, a Bulgarian member of the Cardano community who died in 2021. Cardano’s ADA is priced at $0.454 on Friday, up 0.98% over the last week.

"""More than 50% of reported Bitcoin trading volume is 'likely to be fake or non-economic' — Report""","Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:55:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/more-than-50-of-reported-bitcoin-trading-volume-is-likely-to-be-fake-or-non-economic-report,"""A Forbes analysis of 157 exchanges revealed Bitcoin trading volume may not match up to what the companies claim, particularly if they're small or unregulated.""","Bitcoin trading data from 157 exchanges reportedly did not match up to what companies claimed.According to an Aug. 26 report from Forbes, Javier Pax of the news outlet’s digital asset arm said there was a mismatch between the Bitcoin (BTC) trading data reported by crypto exchanges and the actual numbers. The Forbes contributor found that a group of small exchanges had BTC trading volumes roughly 95% less than those reported, while those operating “with little or no regulatory oversight” — including Binance and Bybit — claimed to have more than double the analyzed volume: $217 billion as opposed to $89 billion. “More than half of all reported trading volume is likely to be fake or non-economic,” said Pax. “The global daily Bitcoin volume for the industry was $128 billion on June 14. That is 51% less than the $262 billion one would get by taking the sum of self-reported volume from multiple sources.”He added:“​​If reported trading volumes for Bitcoin, the most regulated and closely-watched crypto asset around the world, are untrustworthy, then metrics for even smaller assets should be taken with even greater grains of salt. At its best, trading volume is one of the most measurable signs of investor interest, but it can be easily manipulated to convince novice investors that it has much more demand than it actually does.”

Related: Fake employees and social attacks: Crypto recruiting is a minefieldPax cited a 2019 report from Bitwise Asset Management, which claimed that 95% of the reported crypto trading volume on unregulated exchanges appeared to have been faked or was the result of non-economic wash trading. A February report from Chainalysis suggested that wash trading was becoming a point of concern among nonfungible token investors, but the majority of trades using this technique were unprofitable.

'Experts weigh in on the Ethereum vulnerabilities after Merge: Finance Redefined ',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:45:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/experts-weigh-in-on-the-ethereum-vulnerabilities-after-merge-finance-redefined,"'The top 100 DeFi tokens recorded a bearish price action over the past week, with the majority trading in the red, barring a few tokens that have shown even double-digit growth.'","Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you significant developments over the last week.The past week in the DeFi ecosystem saw major developments centered around the Ethereum Merge. Aave (AAVE) community proposed temporarily suspending Ether (ETH) lending before the Merge, citing the potential issue of high ETH utilization that may result in liquidations being hard or impossible and annual percentage yields (APYs) reaching negative figures. An industry expert shared his opinion on possible censorship vulnerabilities that the Ethereum network could eventually face in the wake of its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.Moving ahead of the Ethereum Merge developments, some other major events that made headlines include Babylon Finance’s eventual shutdown after months of trying to recover from the negative momentum caused by the Rari Fuse exploit. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a fresh warning for investors in DeFi platforms, which have been targeted with $1.6 billion in exploits in 2022. The top 100 DeFi tokens recorded a bearish price action over the past week, with the majority trading in the red, barring a few tokens that have shown even double-digit growth.Will Ethereum 2.0 be vulnerable to censorship? Industry professional explainsThe Ethereum network will be able to withstand censorship risks both in the short and long term, according to Ethereum community member and investor Ryan Berckmans.The ban of Ethereum-based privacy tool Tornado Cash by United States authorities earlier this month left many wondering whether Ethereum transactions could also be at risk of censorship, especially after Ethereum’s imminent transition to a proof-of-stake system.Continue readingAave community proposes to suspend ETH lending before the Merge temporarilyWith the Ethereum Merge on the way, the risk research and analysis team Block Analitica proposed a temporary pause in ETH borrowing to mitigate the risks that may lead to a DeFi implosion in the Aave lending protocol during the Merge. The team pointed out the potential issue of high ETH utilization, which may result in liquidations being hard or impossible and the APY's reaching negative figures. Furthermore, the uncertainties surrounding the Merge and a potential Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW) fork may cause liquidity providers to start a bank run, pushing utilization to even higher levels. Continue readingDeFi protocol shuts down months after the Rari Fuse hackBabylon Finance has finally announced that it will shut down after months of trying to recover from the negative momentum caused by the Rari Fuse exploit. In a statement, founder Ramon Recuero explained that the platform experienced an insurmountable negative streak despite their team’s efforts to endure the domino effect caused by the hack. According to Recuero, the protocol lost $3.4 million. Following this, the total value locked within the platform went from $30 million to $4 million. To make matters worse, the Fuse pool was abandoned, taking out a lending market worth $10 million, Recuero noted.Continue readingFBI issues alert over cybercriminal exploits targeting DeFiThe U.S. FBI issued a fresh warning for investors in DeFi platforms, which have been targeted with $1.6 billion in exploits in 2022.

'NFT Steez and Lukso co-founder explore the implications of digital self-sovereignty in Web3 ',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-steez-and-lukso-co-founder-explore-the-implications-of-digital-self-sovereignty-in-web3,'NFT Steez chats with Lukso co-founder Marjorie Hernandez about how Universal Profiles onboard and empower users with digital self-sovereignty',"Sovereign identity has been a hot topic in blockchain and cryptocurrency, especially with the rise of the creator economy. Currently, there are two types of digital identities. One is federated and centralized whereby data is in the control of the service provider. Self-sovereign digital identity is often cited as a human right that can reclaim agency using blockchain technology, but what frameworks exist that aid in governing it?On Aug. 2, NFT Steez, a bi-weekly Twitter Spaces hosted by Alyssa Expósito and Ray Salmond, met Marjorie Hernandez, the co-founder of LUKSO and The Dematerialized to discuss the state of blockchain-based identities and “Universal Profiles.” According to Hernandez, in the future, “everything will have a digital identity.” Onboarding into the digital realm should be frictionless for sovereign “Universal Profiles”During the interview, Hernandez explained the paradigm shift between centralized platforms to a more “platform-less future” and stressed that users need to be in control of their identities and creation on more “agnostic platforms,” where the can own their intellectual property via “Universal Profiles.” Lukso’s integration of Universal Profiles enables users and creators to reclaim their identities and issue their IP in a symbiotic manner between creator and user. According to Hernandez, the Universal Profile can be seen as a personal operating system (OS) whereby one can authenticate themselves, but also send, receive and create assets. As Hernandez puts it, Universal Profiles are a “Swiss Army type tool that is serving so many purposes for the user.” Related: Web3 is crucial for data sovereignty in the metaverseBlockchain-based identities in Web3Understably, the emphasis of identity within Web3 began to spark up again when 2D profile pic (PFP) NFTs began to emerge. This surge was framed as a means to represent and identity oneself as well as a flex, or expression of ego. For some, their physical and social identities were traded for their newly adopted digital avatars. However, Hernandez argues that while some perceive digital as masking one’s true self, she believes that in a “decentralized digital environment,” people will be emboldened “to move beyond these predispositions” and express one's “true real self.” The basis of Hernandez’ thesis is that blockchain-based identity is not only verifiable but gives users 100% control of their data, identity and IP. When asked by a listener what communities should be doing to ensure the standards surrounding self-sovereignty and that users are no longer “consumers” but active co-participants in the ecosystem, Hernandez simply said, “I think it's just being co-creator, right? And you start building with it.” Tune in and listen to the full episode tune in here to NFT Steez and make sure to mark your calendar for the next episode on Sept.16 at 12 pm EST.

'Brazilian SEC seeks to change its role in cryptocurrency regulation',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:15:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-sec-seeks-to-change-its-role-in-cryptocurrency-regulation,"'Resistant to overseeing the space in the past, the agency said it now plans to work on the definition of virtual assets.'","The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly pursuing changes in the country's legal framework with regard to its regulation of cryptocurrencies. According to local media, one major concern is that the bill in question does not appear to consider tokens as digital assets or securities — and they therefore wouldn't fall under SEC regulation. The updated position of the nation's SEC follows the appointment of a new board and the increased relevance of the crypto sector in the country's financial services.Brazilian lawmakers have been working on regulations for cryptocurrencies since 2015, but the Senate only approved the final version of a bill in April 2022. Once Brazil's Congress finishes its final revisions, the bill will be sent to the country's president, who will sign it into law.As described in the approved text, a virtual asset is a digital representation of value that can be traded or transferred electronically, and used for payment or investment purposes. In addition, it outlines the best practices for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and sets up methods to prevent money laundering. Per the bill, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are also not considered securities, while most other tokens are in the middle of discussions about whether they are.In a note to a local newspaper, a representative from Brazil's SEC said:""The mentioned bill needs specific improvements, including the definition of virtual assets, prior authorization requirements, and the approval of business combinations in redundant roles with the Cade [Brazilian Federal Trade Commission].""Legislators said they believe that a possible resolution could be to send the bill to the president to determine via decree what roles the Brazilian Central Bank and the SEC should play in authorizing initial coin offerings and regulating the market. Some legislators consider this measure a legal uncertainty, arguing that an entirely new bill should be introduced. In June, another bill related to cryptocurrencies was submitted to the Brazilian Congress. If approved, the proposal would grant the right to use cryptocurrency as a means of payment, while protecting private keys from being taken by the courts. A draft of the law is currently waiting to be reviewed by the legislators’ committee.

'Snapchat’s parent company shutters Web3 division amid layoffs',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 20:45:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/snapchat-s-parent-company-shutters-web3-division-amid-layoffs,'The company said it will let go of its Web3 division to make way for restructuring after falling behind financial targets.',"Snap Inc's CEO Evan Speigel announced in a note on Friday that the company had made the difficult decision to reduce the size of its workforce by approximately 20%. The note said that this round of layoffs comes after the company experienced slow revenue growth, a slump in stock prices, and a general lag behind its financial targets. Speigel shared:“Our forward-looking revenue visibility remains limited, and our current year-over-year QTD revenue growth of 8% is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.” Snap Inc. will now undertake the task of restructuring in an attempt to ensure the company’s success in a highly competitive space where Instagram and TikTok are currently dominating. As part of its restructuring process, the company has axed its entire Web3 team. Jake Sheinman, head of Snap’s Web3 team, announced his exit from the company on Wednesday in a series of posts on Twitter stating:“As a result of the company restructure, decisions were made to sunset our web 3 team.""I'm humbled to have partnered with the smartest builders, most creative artists, and kindest humans. Today was tough and I'll miss this place dearly but I'm grateful for all of it. Will be taking some personal time in the coming weeks but open to discuss new opportunities 2/2— Jake Sheinman (@jakeryanshein) August 31, 2022

CEO Speigel shared that the restructuring is a part of an effort to focus on three strategic priorities; namely, community growth, revenue growth and augmented reality (AR). Projects that are not in alignment with these areas will be discontinued or have their budgets slashed significantly. At the moment, it appears that Snap will not be prioritizing the budding Web3 and Metaverse space as much as its competition, such as Meta. Although many tech innovators seem to share the opinion that Web3 is going to be the next iteration of the internet, Snap does not appear interested in positioning itself within the blockchain industry.Snap’s layoffs come after other tech companies like Coinbase, LinkedIn, Meta, Apple, Google and Netflix have had to cut down their workforce due to rising interest rates in an inflationary economy.

"'Bitcoin’s in a bear market, but there are plenty of good reasons to keep investing'","Fri, 02 Sep 2022 20:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-in-a-bear-market-but-there-are-plenty-of-good-reasons-to-keep-investing,"'Higher volatility, equity offerings and resistance to regulatory sanctions are just a few reasons why investors should keep an eye on BTC.'","Let's rewind the tape to the end of 2021 when Bitcoin (BTC) was trading near $47,000, which at the time was 32% lower than the all-time high. During that time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market index held 15,650 points, just 3% below its highest-ever mark.Comparing the Nasdaq's 75% gain between 2021 and 2022 to Bitcoin's 544% positive move, one could assume that an eventual correction caused by macroeconomic tensions or a major crisis, would lead to Bitcoin’s price being disproportionately impacted than stocks.Eventually, these “macroeconomic tensions and crises” did occur and Bitcoin price plunging another 57% to $20,250. This shouldn’t be a surprise given that the Nasdaq is down 24.4% as of Sept. 2. Investors also must factor in that the index’s historical 120-day volatility is 40% annualized, versus Bitcoin's 72%, which is roughly 80% higher.That’s the core reason why investors should re-evaluate investing in Bitcoin. The risk-to-reward potential after the downward adjustment in risk assets possibly leaves more upside for the cryptocurrency considering three factors: higher volatility during a moderate recovery, equity offerings and resistance to regulatory sanctions.The problem is the market is now in a drawn-out bear trend and there are no signs that point to a quick recovery because double-digit inflation in many countries continues to pressure the central banks to sustain a tighter stance. Notice below how both Bitcoin and the Nasdaq have struggled throughout 2022.Nasdaq Composite Index (blue) vs Bitcoin (orange). Source: TradingViewThe consequence of raising interest rates and removing debt assets stabilization programs is a recession-like environment. Whether or not a soft landing will be achieved is irrelevant because no sane investor will opt for credit-exposed and growth sectors when the cost of capital is increasing, and consumption is contracting.Bitcoin can crush tech stocks even during moderate recoveriesVolatility is usually interpreted as negative, considering that the movements in price — either up or down — are accelerated. However, if the investor expects some form of recovery over the next 12 to 36 months, there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin will remain under pressure for that long.Let's assume a neutral case, such as Bitcoin recovering 25% of the $48,700 drop since the all-time high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index not only recovers the entire 24.4% losses year-to-date in 2022 but adds another 40% gains over that 1 to 3 year period.That scenario would bring Bitcoin to $32,425, still 53% below its November 2021 all-time high. Thus, for those buying BTC on Sept. 2 at $20,250, that number would represent a 60% profit. On the other hand, under this neutral market, the Nasdaq would reverse its losses and add 40%, reaching 19,563 points and totaling a 64.4% profit. To be clear: that would be 21.6% higher than the current all-time high.Bull markets can create price ceilings for stocksThe top 7 companies on Nasdaq are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Google, Meta and Nvidia, all well-known tech giants. In stock markets, earnings figures are the most critical metric backing investors' optimism, meaning that higher profits can either be redistributed to shareholders, used to buy back stock or reinvested in the business, itself.The problem lies when earnings go up, the companies have enormous incentives for issuing more stock, otherwise known as follow-on offers. Moreover, a tech company must constantly acquire emerging niche competitors to secure its leading position. Thus, bull markets create issues of their own, as valuations become too rich and buybacks make little sense.For Bitcoin, having more miners, investors or infrastructure does not translate to a higher offering because the production schedule has been set from Day 1. The supply is fixed regardless of how the price fluctuates.Bitcoin was designed to survive regulation and centralizationNvidia, a major computer chip and graphics card manufacturer, reached a 68-week low on Sept. 2 after U.S. officials imposed a new license requirement for the company's artificial intelligence chip exports to China and Russia. Meanwhile, in mid-2021, China cracked down on mining facilities in the region, causing Bitcoin's hash rate to drop 50% in 2 months.The main difference in both cases is Bitcoin's automated difficulty adjustment, which reduces the pressure on miners when there's less activity. While the U.S. regulation will likely impact Nvidia's exports, nothing is stopping Taiwanese TSMC chipmaker, South Korean Samsung or Chinese Huawei from growing and exporting products.Bitcoin is a digital peer-to-peer electronic cash system, so it doesn't need centralized exchanges to survive. If governments opt to ban crypto trading completely, that would only emphasize the importance and strength of this decentralized network. Multiple countries have tried to suppress foreign currency from circulating, only to create a shadow market, with facilitators acting as illegal intermediaries.Under the 3 different scenarios, varying from total blockage to a generalized bull market, odds favor Bitcoin against tech stocks at the current prices. Consequently, adjusted for its volatility, the risk reward strongly favors the cryptocurrency.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The S&P 500 rose in response to the report, but later erased its gains, indicating that bears continue to sell on rallies.That may be because the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which had retreated from its Sept.1 20-year high, recovered part of its losses.

This is an important level to watch out for because if buyers clear this hurdle, it will suggest that the negative sentiment could be weakening. The BTC/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA)($22,318).Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $20,576 or the 20-day EMA, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the pair to the critical support zone of $18,910 to $18,626. The bulls are expected to defend this zone aggressively. ETH/USDTEther (ETH) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1,61) on Aug. 31 but a positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the neckline of the head and shoulders (H&S) pattern.ETH/USDT daily chart.

The bears will try to defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and $1,700 but if bulls overcome this barrier, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum. The pair could then rise to $1,848 and later retest the stiff resistance at $2,030.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, the pair could again drop to the neckline. If this support breaks down, the pair could drop to $1,422 and then to $1,280.

If they manage to do that, it will be the first sign that the bears may be losing their grip. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to $308 where the bears may again mount a strong defense. Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and bears are selling on minor rallies. That will increase the possibility of a break below the support at $275. If that happens, the pair will complete a bearish H&S pattern. The pair could then slide to $240 and later to the pattern target at $212.XRP/USDTXRP has been trading between $0.32 and $0.34 since Aug. 28.

If this level also gives way, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend.This negative view could invalidate in the near term if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA.

'Crypto Biz: You can’t stop the Tether FUD ',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 19:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-biz-you-can-t-stop-the-tether-fud,"""This week's Crypto Biz newsletter: The Wall Street Journal questions Tether's business model; venture capitalists are scooping up crypto at rock bottom prices.""","In the world of crypto, FUD stands for fear, uncertainty and doubt. It’s often evoked intentionally to draw negative attention to a particular project or business. One of crypto’s most enduring legacies has been the constant FUD surrounding Tether, whose USDT stablecoin commands a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. Whether intentional or not, The Wall Street Journal ran a story this week claiming that Tether was on the edge of technical insolvency and that it wouldn’t take much to push the stablecoin issuer into financial peril. Of course, Tether didn’t take it lying down and immediately issued a response to what it considered to be a “disinformation” campaign by the Journal. Regardless of which side of the debate you’re on, it’s becoming clear that there is a strong media bias against Tether. In fact, the Journal ran a story a few months ago claiming that more hedge funds were betting against the stablecoin around the same time that the crypto market as a whole was plunging. This week’s Crypto Biz newsletter dissects the Tether controversy and gives you the latest information on the state of venture capital and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).Tether responds to Wall Street Journal ‘disinformation’In an article published on Saturday, The Wall Street Journal claimed that even a 0.3% decline in Tether’s assets could deem the stablecoin issuer “technically insolvent.” The Journal was referring to Tether’s most recent disclosure on its website, which showed that assets only narrowly exceeded its liabilities. Tether clapped back and accused the Journal of engaging in unnecessary FUD. “The article seeks to discredit the work that Tether has put into transparent and honest communication to the public,” Tether said. “Perhaps the WSJ has confused Tether with some of its competitors.” If you’re concerned about Tether FUD, don’t sweat it. The stablecoin issuer has been constantly attacked by mainstream media since at least 2017.Lots of milking pic.twitter.com/ZBJnmvai9f— Paolo Ardoino  (@paoloardoino) August 29, 2022

This week, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced that his venture firm Seven Seven Six is looking is raising $177.6 million to invest in various crypto and blockchain startups. “This is the best time to buy if you’re really long on the industry. It’s on sale. Everything is on sale,” said Katelin Holloway, Seven Seven Six’s founding partner.

‘Most of crypto is still junk’ and lacks use case — JPMorgan blockchain headAfter bashing Bitcoin (BTC) for years, JPMorgan has spun out a dedicated division for digital assets — a clear sign that the major banks acknowledge the sector’s long-term value proposition. Umar Farooq, who heads JPMorgan’s digital asset division, recently told a panel that most crypto projects are “junk” and not worth pursuing as investments. “I mean, with the exception of, I would say, a few dozen tokens, everything else that has been mentioned is either noise or, frankly, is just gonna go away,” he told the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Green Shots Seminar. I think most investors would agree that most crypto projects don’t have a future. The problem is agreeing on which projects outside of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) are not junk. Don’t miss it! Crypto market dump — Is it over or the start of the next mega crash?Crypto winter is starting to look like a crypto deep freeze as Bitcoin, Ether and altcoins all plunged this week. Have we seen a definitive bottom in crypto prices, or is there more pain on the way this fall? In this week’s Market Report, I sat down with fellow analysts Marcel Pechman and Benton Yaun to discuss where crypto prices could be headed next.

The protocol said it will compensate all users for any missing funds related to the exploit, and directly addressed the hacker to give them an opportunity to return the funds in exchange for “a conversation with our team” and 15% of what was taken — roughly $40,000.“We know the addresses you own have received funds from central exchanges and we can track you down from there,” said Kyber Network. “We also know the addresses you own have OpenSea profiles and we can track you through the NFT communities or directly through OpenSea. As the doors of exchanges close upon you, you will not be able to cash out without revealing yourself.”

Kyber Network reported shutting down its frontend following the discovery of a “suspicious element” at 8:24 AM UTC on Sept. 1. The platform disabled its user interface and found “a malicious code” in its Google Tag Manager, which targeted “whale wallets with large amounts,” giving the hacker the ability to transfer funds to different addresses. According to Kyber Network co-founder Loi Luu, this was the first hack on the protocol in five years.“The attack was identified and put a stop to after 2 hours of investigations,” said Kyber Network. “This attack was an FE exploit and there is no smart contract vulnerability.”Related: DeFi isn’t dead, it just needs to fix these 3 critical problemsHackers have used exploits to execute attacks on many decentralized finance protocols, including $100 million being removed from the Horizon Bridge in June and draining $200 million worth of crypto from the Nomad token bridge in August. Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 11 that the overwhelming majority of attackers responsible for the Nomad bridge hack copied the original exploit, directing funds to addresses they chose.

According to the report, the gaming sector accounts for approximately 50.51% of industry usage month-over-month (MoM), as per August numbers.While overall the numbers are a good indicator for the sector, it is a decrease from the previous month. Last month, the gaming sector made up approximately 57.30% of industry usage (MoM).The data from DappRadar comes from the daily Unique Active Wallets (UAW). According to the surveyor, there are around 847,230 gaming-related UAW active daily with nearly $698 million in transactions.Source: DappRadarGaming has long been touted as a gateway to the world of Web3, blockchain, and crypto. Another recent survey from ChainPlay highlighted that of 2,428 surveyed GameFi investors, 75% said they joined the space solely on the premise of gaming.It’s not just GameFi investors that believe in the sector as a proponent for mass adoption. In a panel at Korean Blockchain Week 2022, experts said GameFi and crypto naturally go together. Moreover, there was speculation that the majority of games will have an in-game crypto economy within the next few years.Long-time legacy gaming companies in the traditional gaming sector also have their eyes on Web3. The head of Xbox even stated his optimism toward metaverse gaming, but with some caution toward play-to-earn (P2E) crypto games.According to research from the cybersecurity auditing firm Hacken, many projects in the GameFi industry don’t prioritize security and are overdue for a major hack. The Ronin token bridge from Axie Infinity was one of crypto’s largest hacks with a $600 million loss in tokens back in March.Recently in an analysis of 60 Web3-based games, it was found that 40% of users were automated bots or multiple accounts coming from one single entity.

The acquisition is contingent on both parties signing definitive agreements and requires regulatory approval. Robert Odell, SALT’s chief product officer, described the potential acquisition as being a unity of first-movers in the cryptocurrency market:“This potential union will combine SALT, the world's first crypto lending platform, with BF, the world’s first Bitcoin and crypto securities business.”The agreement, should it go through, would not impact existing SALT customers. “We want to assure you that there will be no changes to your loan as a result of this announcement,” the company said.Founded in 2016, SALT is one of the first crypto-backed lending platforms to give borrowers the ability to obtain U.S. dollar-denominated loans collateralized by digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). The company’s founding preceded the so-called DeFi Summer of 2020, which saw dozens of decentralized finance protocols reach multi-billion-dollar valuations.Bnk To The Future is a micro venture capital firm that allows investors to back early-stage fintech and crypto companies for as little as $1,000.

'What would you ask Satoshi Nakamoto? Community answers',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 15:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-would-you-ask-satoshi-nakamoto-community-answers,"'From their private keys and thoughts about mining to artificial intelligence conspiracies, the crypto community shared what they would ask the inventor of Bitcoin.'","After more than 10 years since the inception of Bitcoin (BTC), its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto still remains a mystery. Being an inspirational figure to the crypto space, Cointelegraph asked Twitter what questions they would have for Nakamoto if they had a chance to talk. From asking about their private keys and thoughts about Bitcoin mining to conspiracy theories about artificial intelligence trying to take control of humanity, the community members shared their most colorful questions for the Bitcoin creator. A Twitter user replied that they would have a conversation with Nakamoto about various topics from the economy to coding, up to their perspectives on the universe, life and health. The community member said that ""a brilliant mind has to be heard on anything.""Another community member brought up the topic of Bitcoin mining. The Twitter user said that they would ask Nakamoto about their thoughts about less energy-intensive alternative blockchains and if they would consider it as a feasible replacement for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, another question poked at the BTC creator’s thoughts on his vision versus the current status. They tweeted: 

One user brought up the topic of recovering lost Bitcoin. The Twitter user said that they would ask Nakamoto if there is any way to recover all those lost BTC. In a previous interview with Cointelegraph, Kim Grauer, an executive at analytics firm Chainalysis, said that around 3.7 million BTC, worth $75 billion at the time of writing, has been lost.Many believe that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation due to its inherent feature of having a limited supply. This may be why another response raised the issue of the public's understanding of money and scarcity. According to a community member, they would ask Nakamoto if they had ever anticipated that the masses would have little understanding of financial concepts and scarcity, suggesting that if people understood, they would be all over Bitcoin and ditching inflationary currencies. As the Twitter thread got more replies, the answers started to become more creative and dystopian. One user wrote that they would ask Nakamoto if they are an artificial intelligence life form that teleported from the future to build a decentralized computing infrastructure and ""take control of humanity."" Apart from these, one of the most asked questions revolved around asking for the Bitcoin founder’s private keys. After all, Nakamoto’s wallet is believed to have around 1.1 million BTC, which is worth $22.5 billion at the current market price and was worth $77.6 billion at the currency’s all-time high. Related: 62% of wallets did not sell Bitcoin for a year amid the bear market: DataOne of the most prominent crypto projects that followed Bitcoin's example is the smart contract platform Ethereum. Its native token, Ether (ETH), is currently the second most valuable crypto in terms of market capitalization. In July, Cointelegraph asked the community if they thought ETH has a chance ever to surpass BTC. While some believe that ETH has the potential to take the spot as the top dog in crypto, others believe that Bitcoin will always be the ""king.""  Delivered every Monday Subscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletterEmail Address Subscribe By subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Services and Privacy Policy

'Crypto winter teaches tough lessons about custody and taking control ',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 15:04:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-winter-teaches-tough-lessons-about-custody-and-taking-control,"'Many agree that digital assets should be held in hard wallets, but recent actions in the EU and the U.S. may make that more difficult, not easier.'","The crypto winter has pumped new life into the adage “Not your keys, not your coins,” particularly after the collapse of some high-profile enterprises like the Celsius Network, whose funds were frozen in June. Just last week, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier hammered home the point further, warning: “Don’t trust your coins and your private keys to anyone because you don’t know what they’re going to do with it.”The basic idea behind the adage, familiar to many crypto veterans, is that if you don’t personally hold your private keys (i.e., passwords) in an offline “cold wallet,” then you don’t really control your digital assets. But, Gauthier was also framing the issue in a larger context as the world moves from Web2 to Web3:“A lot of people are still in Web2 [...] because they want to stay in the matrix where they’re being controlled, because it’s easier, it’s you know just click yes yes yes and then someone else is going to deal with your problems.” But, giving away control won’t set you free. “Taking responsibility is how you become free.” Admittedly, Gauthier has a self-interest here — Ledger is one of the world’s largest cold-wallet providers. Then, too, he may have been stating the obvious. In May, Coinbase acknowledged in an SEC 10-Q filing that if it ever went bankrupt, customers that entrusted their digital assets to the exchange “could be treated as our general unsecured creditors,” i.e., could find themselves standing at the back of the creditors’ line in bankruptcy proceedings. “It doesn’t matter that the exchange’s contract with you says you ‘own’ the currency,” Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin told Barron's at the time, “That’s not determinative of what will happen in bankruptcy.” But, Gauthier’s statement raises other questions, too. This notion of seizing “control” of one’s keys and coins could become more complicated given recent regulatory proposals in Europe, as well as a key government agency interpretation in the United States. Moreover, as the world transitions from Web2 to Web3, is it really so certain that centralized solutions like Coinbase and others might still not have an important role to play with regard to custody and, yes, even privacy?Learning the hard wayGenerally speaking, it appears that consumers still do not understand the potential risks when they turn their crypto private keys over to centralized platforms and exchanges.“It’s been made abundantly clear that even the most seemingly trustworthy custodians can still make grave missteps with user funds,” Nick Saponaro, CEO at the Divi Project, told Cointelegraph. “The promise of self-sovereign ownership of your money is immediately obliterated when users hand over their private keys to any third-party, regardless of that third-party's genuine intent.”“All crypto users should learn and be responsible for the security of their own coins by storing them securely on hardware wallets,” Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer at CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph.“However, this is not a popular move because for most crypto users, it is probably more convenient to store them on centralized exchanges.”Recent: Blockchain firms fund university research hubs to advance growthStill, a centralized exchange (CEX) can be useful at times and maybe we should expect to live in a hybrid cryptoverse for a while, with both cold and hot wallets, centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).“There is a case for using centralized exchanges for sending funds to others to not doxx your crypto addresses,” said Ong. “This is because when you send a transaction to someone else, they will know your address and can see your balance, historical transactions, and all future transactions.” Indeed, Ong tweeted recently: “The basic advice now is to have multiple wallets for various purposes and to fund these wallets using centralized exchanges. This works well but it’s not good enough. If you use FTX or Binance, Uncle Sam and Changpeng Zao will know all your wallets and they can profile you instead.”Continued Ong, “To get full privacy for your new wallet, a service like Tornado Cash is needed. Granted, it’s probably more expensive, slow and tedious,” but having such an option would ensure privacy and make crypto behave more like cash, he added.Justin d’Anethan, institutional sales director at Amber Group, agreed that trade-offs remain. “You can’t do as many sophisticated trades from a private wallet as you can on a centralized platform, or at least not as easily and efficiently,” he told Cointelegraph. Large, sophisticated traders will always need to have some of their holdings on exchanges to optimize returns. In his personal case:“I hold a chunk of my core holdings in private wallets, but I definitely hold some assets on centralized platforms for yield generation, some rebalancing, etc.”Corporate entities, especially, may not want to handle the operational side of a trade, including investment and custody, and they may also want to interact with a recognized and established centralized entity that can perform due diligence. Also, corporations may want to have an identifiable and liquid entity to sue “in the event of an error,” added d’Anethan.On the retail side, setting up a private wallet can still be daunting, which may explain why so many entrust private keys to CEXs and the like, even if it isn’t always the best way. As d’Anethan told Cointelegraph:“You might not know how — or have the motivation — to buy a private wallet, set it up to hold your private key and bear the risk of losing it. So, the path of least resistance wins.” Do regulators still not “get it?”Elsewhere, self-hosted wallet providers may soon face tough regulations in Europe if and when the EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) proposal takes hold. It could overturn this whole notion about taking control of one’s private keys and coins. “Effectively, it would amount to a ‘de facto’ ban on self-hosted wallets by enforcing to connect personal identities with self-hosted wallets,” wrote Philipp Sandner and Agata Ferreira.Mikolaj Barczentewicz, associate professor at the United Kingdom’s University of Surrey, told Cointelegraph: “The TFR proposal doesn’t ban self-custodied wallets, but it does incentivize service providers to treat them as ‘high risk’ for money laundering.[…] It may become practically very difficult to transact using self-hosted wallets.”Defenders of the TFR might respond that it’s not regulators’ fault that businesses are not better at risk-based analysis and at distinguishing situations of genuinely high risk of criminality, but “I don’t think that answer works,” continued Barczentewicz. “It shows a lack of understanding — or care — for the fact that regulations need to be designed to be workable in the real world. The EU is basically saying to businesses: ‘You figure it out.’”However, the biggest threat to self-custodied wallets in Barczentewicz’s view “is something like the scenario we’ve been watching in reaction to Tornado Cash being sanctioned by the U.S.: Businesses are afraid and engaging in over-compliance, doing more than the law requires.”As reported, on Aug. 8, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued legal sanctions against digital currency mixer Tornado Cash for its role in laundering over $455 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean-linked hacking organization Lazarus Group.According to data analytics firm Chainalysis, the obligations of non-custodial crypto wallet providers are now unclear under OFAC’s recent designation: “An extreme interpretation could mean that non-custodial wallet providers might also need to block transfers to the sanctioned addresses, though this would be unprecedented.” At a minimum, government actions like these suggest that cold-wallet solutions to help crypto users take control of their private keys could become more problematic — not less — at least in the immediate future.An education imperative?Overall, does the crypto industry face an education challenge here i.e., to explain the importance of cold storage and individual “responsibility” to both individuals and policymakers? “I think we have to be honest with ourselves,” answered Saponaro. “Yes, education can help some individuals avoid the pitfalls we’ve witnessed in recent months, but most people will not read every article, watch every video or take the time to educate themselves.” Developers have a responsibility to develop products that guide users “into learning by doing.” “The crypto community, including in the EU, can still do much more to educate policymakers,” added Barczentewicz. “But this education cannot be limited to just explaining how crypto works. It is a mistake to think that once policymakers ‘get it,’ they will come up with sensible rules on their own.” The crypto community needs to be proactive in proposing detailed technical and regulatory notions of how to fight crime and malfeasance without giving up key benefits of crypto, like self-custody, he said. “It is not enough just to mention buzzwords like ‘zero knowledge proofs’ and then expect the policymakers to do the hard work.”Is taking “control” really important?What about Gauthier’s larger point that people simply have to learn to take ""responsibility"" for their assets — digital and otherwise — because “taking responsibility is how you become free?”“Crypto is a game-changer because we now have full control of our money without the need to trust any third-party,” said Ong. That said, some people “may choose to pass on the responsibility and trust a third-party custodian who may be better equipped to store their coins safely — and that is acceptable too,” he told Cointelegraph. Recent: Crypto volatility may soon recede despite high correlation with TradFi“In the crypto space, you typically have very binary opinions about how things can grow from here. I think the truth is somewhat in the middle,” said d’Anethan, adding:“One is delusional if one thinks every individual and corporate is going full DeFi tomorrow. But, one would also be delusional if one thinks the growing digital world will forever stay within the Web2 infrastructure.”What may be best is to have both centralized and decentralized platforms, “so that the user base can gradually shift where it sees the most value — however long that takes,” he said.
