And that’s totally fine,” he explained, adding that the same production halt would be seen as a failure for Solana. </p><blockquote>“If there’s two hours between blocks in Solana, the network’s dead because it’s designed to make a block every 400 milliseconds.”</blockquote><p>Solana was built to be a high transaction speed, low-cost smart contract platform, which processes “30 million transactions per day,” making it “more than all other chains combined,” said Yakovenko</p><blockquote>“Once you make a faster network, the failure case is different than one on something like Bitcoin or Ethereum.”</blockquote><p>However, Yakovenko argued that the outages themselves aren’t entirely a bad thing “because all [of] these challenges are coming because we have users.”</p><p>“This is our biggest challenge, which is maybe the one that I like to have because of all these challenges that are coming because we have users on the chain on a daily basis,"" he added. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/reliably-unreliable-solana-price-dives-after-latest-network-outage""><strong><em>Reliably unreliable: Solana price dives after latest network outage</em></strong></a></p><p>Solana has suffered at least seven network outages since its launch in 2020, with five of them coming in 2022 alone. One of the longest production halts lasted up to 17 hours in September 2021.</p><p>Yakovenko said the network outages resulted from the validators not being able to process transaction loads at peak periods:</p><blockquote>“I think some people have seen 10 million packets per second being submitted to a validator. And if there’s a bug in any one of those validators where memory grows really [...] quickly, that validator could shut down.”</blockquote><p>Among the most notable ones include a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-attributes-major-outage-to-denial-of-service-attack-targeting-dex-offering"">denial-of-service attack</a> caused by bots spamming the Raydium protocol in Sept. 2021, another <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-suffers-7th-outage-in-2022-as-bots-invade-the-network"">seven hour outage caused by bots</a> on a nonfungible token (NFT) application in May. 2022 and a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/reliably-unreliable-solana-price-dives-after-latest-network-outage"">code bug halting block production </a>on the network in Jun. 2022. </p><p>The Solana token, <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index"">SOL,</a> is currently priced at $32, up 3.83% over the last 24 hours.</p><div class=""article-subscription-widget""><div class=""article-subscription-widget__form""><form class=""article-subscription-widget-form""><div class=""article-subscription-widget-form__delivery""> Delivered every Thursday </div><div class=""article-subscription-widget-form__title"">Subscribe to <br/> our Crypto Biz newsletter</div><div class=""article-subscription-widget-form__input-wrap""><input class=""article-subscription-widget-form__input"" id=""input"" type=""text""/><label class=""article-subscription-widget-form__input-label"" for=""input"">Email Address</label><!-- --></div><div class=""article-subscription-widget-form__btn-wrap""><button class=""article-subscription-widget-form__btn"" type=""submit""> Subscribe </button></div><div class=""article-subscription-widget-form__tos"">By subscribing, you agree to our <a href=""/terms-and-privacy"" target=""_blank"">Terms of Services and Privacy Policy</a></div></form></div><div class=""article-subscription-widget__image-wrap""><img alt="""" class=""article-subscription-widget__image article-subscription-widget__image_crypto_biz"" pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1974389a0c091b741dbfeee6d3697bd9.svg""/></div></div></div>"

          1.
        </span> <h2>
          Does the government know who owns Bitcoin?
        </h2></div> <div class=""explained-post-content__item-content""><p dir=""ltr""><em>At the basis of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) stands <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know"">blockchain technology</a>. A fundamental characteristic of blockchain technology is transparency, meaning that anyone, including the government, can observe all cryptocurrency transactions conducted via that blockchain.</em></p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are publicly accessible because of the transparent nature of blockchain technology. Besides, the history of Bitcoin transactions is permanently stored on the <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-does-blockchain-work-a-beginners-guide-to-blockchain-technology/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-does-blockchain-work-a-beginners-guide-to-blockchain-technology"">Bitcoin blockchain</a>, implying that it is not hard to observe BTC transactions. The government, in the form of law enforcement authorities, may thus watch what happens on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So, can authorities like the police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) trace Bitcoin ownership? And, do authorities know who owns which Bitcoin? The traceability of BTC transactions depends on whether someone’s transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain can be linked to their identity. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Anyone can observe all cryptocurrency transactions of any <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-btc/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-btc"">Bitcoin wallet address</a>. To find out where the Bitcoin is coming from and where they are being sent, authorities can analyze the BTC addresses that are used for transacting. In this manner, authorities get insights into what is happening and when. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Many Bitcoin users reveal their identity at some point (for instance, on <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/binance-vs-coinbase-how-do-they-compare/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/binance-vs-coinbase-how-do-they-compare"">centralized exchanges</a> or through interactions with known wallets). Thus, BTC transactions do not always remain 100% anonymous and the government can trace Bitcoin ownership whenever (a series of) Bitcoin transactions can be linked to one’s identity. With that new knowledge, governments can enforce duties such as <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-for-beginners/how-to-file-crypto-taxes-a-guide-to-cryptocurrency-taxation-and-laws/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-for-beginners/how-to-file-crypto-taxes-a-guide-to-cryptocurrency-taxation-and-laws"">Bitcoin or cryptocurrency tax liabilities</a> or fight criminal conduct like <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-for-beginners/eus-anti-money-laundering-directive-5-amld5/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-for-beginners/eus-anti-money-laundering-directive-5-amld5"">money laundering</a>.</p>

'The Bitcoin bottom — Are we there yet? Analysts discuss the factors impacting BTC price ',"Sat, 03 Sep 2022 17:13:09 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-bitcoin-bottom-are-we-there-yet-analysts-discuss-the-factors-impacting-btc-price,"'$20,000 is becoming the “new” resistance for BTC price even though multiple indicators are screaming “buy.” Analysts share their views on the future of Bitcoin price.'","<div class=""post-content"" data-v-3511d6da=""""><p>When Bitcoin was trading above $60,000, the smartest analysts and financial-minded folk told investors that BTC price would never fall below its previous all time high. </p><p>These same individuals also said $50,000 was a buy the dip opportunity, and then they said $35,000 was a generational buy opportunity. Later on, they also suggested that BTC would never fall under $20,000. </p><p>Of course, “now” is a great time to buy the dip, and one would think that buying BTC at or under $10,000 would also be the purchase of a lifetime. But by now, all the so-called “experts'' have fallen quiet and are nowhere to be seen or heard. </p><p>So, investors are left to their own devices and thoughts to contemplate whether or not the bottom is in. Should one be patient and wait for the forecast “drop to $10,000” or is now the time to buy Bitcoin and altcoins?</p><p>Generally, calling price bottoms is a futile task. What's really important to focus on is whether or not there are fundamental reasons for choosing to or not to invest in Bitcoin. </p><p>Sure, price has changed drastically, but have Bitcoin’s network fundamentals and the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin as an asset improved or degraded? It’s important to zoom in on this data because for investors, this is where one should be sourcing their confidence and investment thesis. </p><p>This is exactly why Cointelegraph hosted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mnxeRyqBaaKX?s=20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter Spaces with analysts</a> Joe Burnett of Blockware Solutions and Colin Harper of Luxor Mining. Here’s a few highlights from the conversation.</p><h2>Equities markets will decide when Bitcoin price can “go back up” </h2><p>According to Blockware Solutions analyst Joe Burnett, Bitcoin price is heavily impacted by Federal Reserve policy and its impact on equities markets. Burnett said: </p><blockquote>“The macro environment is obviously heavily weighing on the price of Bitcoin. High CPI inflation has led to an aggressive Fed since November of 2021. Higher interest rates inevitably cause all assets to come down. Interest rates are basically gravity on financial assets, just basically discounted cash flow analysis. And these increasing interest rates are an attempt to destroy demand and and destroy inflation by the Fed. It's obviously putting pressure on all risk assets, including Bitcoin.” </blockquote><p>When asked about the Bitcoin hash ribbons on-chain indicator suggesting that BTC had bottomed and miners had capitulated confirming that the Bitcoin bottom was in, Burnett said “I think with every sort of like on chain type metric, you definitely have to take it with a grain of salt. You can't look at it in a vacuum and say, yes, the bitcoin bottom is in.” </p><p>Burnett said: </p><blockquote>“If US equities do make new lows, I certainly expect Bitcoin to follow. With that being said, I mean, if you're looking at the fundamentals of Bitcoin itself, I think minor capitulations do typically mark Bitcoin bottoms. And a hash driven indicator that Charles Edwards created is basically depicting that there was a miner capitulation this summer.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/canaan-exec-says-opportunity-outweighs-crisis-as-bitcoin-miners-struggle-with-shrinking-profits/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/canaan-exec-says-opportunity-outweighs-crisis-as-bitcoin-miners-struggle-with-shrinking-profits"">Canaan exec says opportunity outweighs crisis as Bitcoin miners struggle with shrinking profits</a></em></strong></p><h2>Synergy between Big Energy and Bitcoin miners is a net positive for BTC</h2><p>Discussion of the growing partnership between big energy providers, oil and gas companies and industrial-size Bitcoin miners has been a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9am5usLKKs8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hot topic throughout 2022</a>, and when asked about the direct benefits of this relationship to Bitcoin itself, Colin Harper said:</p><blockquote>“I don't think that mining does anything bad or good for Bitcoin. I think it's good for Bitcoin in the sense that it will actually in the long run strengthen network security, decentralize mining and put it in like basically every corner of the globe if you have energy producers mining it. But in terms of actually doing anything to the price, I think that's just a kind of a wider adoption case. And as to whether or not people will be using it day to day as a medium of exchange, store of value and just general investment.”</blockquote><p>Harper elaborated with, “If these companies do start mining it, then it becomes more palatable. It becomes less stigmatized. Depending on, I guess the oil producer and that person's politics.” </p><p>When asked about what Bitcoin mass adoption might look like in the future, in relation to the growth of the mining industry, Harper explained that: </p><blockquote>“It's just going to be a matter of time before they start integrating Bitcoin into their stacks. And I think that's when things get interesting in terms of mining as an industry because if you have the producers of the energy and the people who own the energy mining Bitcoin, then that makes it very hard for people without those assets to eventually turn a profit because you're going to see hash price, which already trades in backwardation. Eventually, you can imagine a future where only energy producers and those who are invested with or embedded with energy producers can actually turn a profit on their bitcoin mining.”</blockquote><h2>Regulation and a growing desire to self-custody will drive Bitcoin Lightning Network growth</h2><p>Both analysts agreed that while it may take a handful of years, the growth potential for layer-2 Bitcoin is bright. Burnett predicted that “over time more and more people will learn to demand final settlement of their Bitcoin, meaning that more people will hold their own keys.” </p><p>According to Burnett: </p><blockquote>“If Bitcoin adoption grows by 100x or 1000x, there's going to be a lot more competition for scarce block space and on-chain fees will likely rise just because people will be demanding much more settlement, magnitudes more settlement on the base layer. But the block space to settle on the base layer is fixed. So these on chain fees rising will basically, in my opinion, potentially make lightning channel liquidity that's already open and available. It'll make it more valuable.”</blockquote><p>Harper wholeheartedly agreed and added that, in his opinion, the Lightning Network “will be the thing that allows Bitcoin to be used as a worldwide medium of exchange and also, like Jack Mallers has put it, It's the thing that can kind of separate Bitcoin, the asset from Bitcoin, the payment network in a way that's actually scalable.” </p><p>Tune in <a href=""https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mnxeRyqBaaKX?s=20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here to listen</a> to the full conversation of the Twitter Space. </p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"">Disclaimer.

In fact, history has proven that one of the best times to buy Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) is when no one is talking about Bitcoin.</p><p>Remember the 2018–2020 crypto winter? I do. Hardly anyone, including mainstream media, was talking about crypto in a positive or negative way. It was during this time of prolonged downtrend and lengthy sideways chop that smart investors were accumulating in preparation for the next bull trend. </p><p>Of course, nobody knew “when” this parabolic advance would take place, but the example is purely meant to illustrate that crypto might be in a crab market, but there are still great strategies for investing in Bitcoin. </p><p>Let’s take a look at three. </p><h2>Accumulation via dollar-cost averaging</h2><p>It’s helpful to be price agnostic when it comes to investing in assets over the long term. A price agnostic investor is immune to fluctuations in value and will identify a few assets that they believe in and continue to add to the positions. If the project has good fundamentals, a strong, active use case and a healthy network, it makes more sense to just dollar-cost average (DCA) into a position.</p><p>Take, for example, this chart from DCA.BTC. </p><figure><img pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-09/98100753-ea9e-4d67-aa30-78d4ae2274ab.png""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Results of weekly dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin.

Probably not soon: Why Bitcoin traders should make friends with the trend</em></strong></a></p><h2>Do nothing, until the trend changes</h2><p>Trading during a bear market is hard, and capital and portfolio preservation are the top priorities. For this reason, it’s best for some investors to just wait for confirmation of a trend change. As the saying goes, “the trend is your friend.” Everyone is a genius and a superb trader during a bull market, so if that was you, then wait for the next bull trend to roll around and go be a happy-go-lucky genius then. </p><p>Downtrends, consolidation and bear markets are notorious for chopping up traders and reducing one’s portfolio size, so it’s unwise to trade against the trend unless one has a PNL positive method for trading during bear trends and some skill at shorting. </p><p>For crypto investors, it’s important not to live in a vacuum and keep an eye on the equities markets. Crypto traders have a tendency to only focus on crypto markets, and this is a mistake because equities markets and BTC and Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) prices have shown a strong correlation in the past two years. In one’s charting suite of choice, it would be wise to keep the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones or Nasdaq charts up alongside BTC’s or ETH’s daily chart. </p><figure><img pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-09/2a12027e-0d27-4ade-9a16-6234ec99f706.png""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Bitcoin correlation to equities markets.

It is easy to be misled by the minuscule moves that occur in Bitcoin’s four-hour and daily price charts, and one could easily be lured into some hefty positions based on the belief that BTC is on the verge of a reversal. </p><p>Keeping an eye on the market structure and price action of the largest equities indexes will provide crucial insight into the strength and duration of any bullish or bearish trend that Bitcoin might exhibit. </p><p>This newsletter was written by Big Smokey, the author of <a href=""https://bigsmokey.substack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Humble Pontificator</a> Substack and resident newsletter author at Cointelegraph.

According to Hernandez, the Universal Profile can be seen as a personal operating system (OS) whereby one can authenticate themselves, but also send, receive and create assets. </p><p>As Hernandez puts it, Universal Profiles are a “Swiss Army type tool that is serving so many purposes for the user.” </p><p><strong><em><u>R</u>elated: <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/web3-is-crucial-for-data-sovereignty-in-the-metaverse/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-is-crucial-for-data-sovereignty-in-the-metaverse"">Web3 is crucial for data sovereignty in the metaverse</a></em></strong></p><h2>Blockchain-based identities in Web3</h2><p>Understably, the emphasis of identity within Web3 began to spark up again when 2D profile pic (PFP) NFTs began to emerge.

"'Bitcoin’s in a bear market, but there are plenty of good reasons to keep investing'","Fri, 02 Sep 2022 20:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-in-a-bear-market-but-there-are-plenty-of-good-reasons-to-keep-investing,"'Higher volatility, equity offerings and resistance to regulatory sanctions are just a few reasons why investors should keep an eye on BTC.'","<div class=""post-content"" data-v-3511d6da=""""><p>Let's rewind the tape to the end of 2021 when Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) was trading near $47,000, which at the time was 32% lower than the all-time high. During that time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market index held 15,650 points, just 3% below its highest-ever mark.</p><p>Comparing the Nasdaq's 75% gain between 2021 and 2022 to Bitcoin's 544% positive move, one could assume that an eventual correction caused by macroeconomic tensions or a major crisis, would lead to Bitcoin’s price being disproportionately impacted than stocks.</p><p>Eventually, these “macroeconomic tensions and crises” did occur and Bitcoin price plunging another 57% to $20,250. This shouldn’t be a surprise given that the Nasdaq is down 24.4% as of Sept. 2. Investors also must factor in that the index’s historical 120-day volatility is 40% annualized, versus Bitcoin's 72%, which is roughly 80% higher.</p><p>That’s the core reason why investors should re-evaluate investing in Bitcoin. The risk-to-reward potential after the downward adjustment in risk assets possibly leaves more upside for the cryptocurrency considering three factors: higher volatility during a moderate recovery, equity offerings and resistance to regulatory sanctions.</p><p>The problem is the market is now in <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/5-metrics-to-monitor-before-investing-in-crypto-during-a-bear-market/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-metrics-to-monitor-before-investing-in-crypto-during-a-bear-market"">a drawn-out bear trend</a><a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/5-metrics-to-monitor-before-investing-in-crypto-during-a-bear-market/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-metrics-to-monitor-before-investing-in-crypto-during-a-bear-market""></a> and there are no signs that point to a quick recovery because double-digit inflation in many countries continues to pressure the central banks to sustain a tighter stance. Notice below how both Bitcoin and the Nasdaq have struggled throughout 2022.</p><figure><img pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-09/598d1c96-4272-4eea-83a6-22a66f24fe9f.png""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Nasdaq Composite Index (blue) vs Bitcoin (orange). Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The consequence of raising interest rates and removing debt assets stabilization programs is a recession-like environment. Whether or not a soft landing will be achieved is irrelevant because no sane investor will opt for credit-exposed and growth sectors when the cost of capital is increasing, and consumption is contracting.</p><h2>Bitcoin can crush tech stocks even during moderate recoveries</h2><p>Volatility is usually interpreted as negative, considering that the movements in price — either up or down — are accelerated. However, if the investor expects some form of recovery over the next 12 to 36 months, there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin will remain under pressure for that long.</p><p>Let's assume a neutral case, such as Bitcoin recovering 25% of the $48,700 drop since the all-time high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index not only recovers the entire 24.4% losses year-to-date in 2022 but adds another 40% gains over that 1 to 3 year period.</p><p>That scenario would bring Bitcoin to $32,425, still 53% below its November 2021 all-time high. Thus, for those buying BTC on Sept. 2 at $20,250, that number would represent a 60% profit. </p><p>On the other hand, under this neutral market, the Nasdaq would reverse its losses and add 40%, reaching 19,563 points and totaling a 64.4% profit. To be clear: that would be 21.6% higher than the current all-time high.</p><h2>Bull markets can create price ceilings for stocks</h2><p>The top 7 companies on Nasdaq are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Google, Meta and Nvidia, all well-known tech giants. In stock markets, earnings figures are the most critical metric backing investors' optimism, meaning that higher profits can either be redistributed to shareholders, used to buy back stock or reinvested in the business, itself.</p><p>The problem lies when earnings go up, the companies have enormous incentives for issuing more stock, otherwise known as follow-on offers. Moreover, a tech company must constantly acquire emerging niche competitors to secure its leading position. Thus, bull markets create issues of their own, as valuations become too rich and buybacks make little sense.</p><p>For Bitcoin, having more miners, investors or infrastructure does not translate to a higher offering because the production schedule has been set from Day 1. The supply is fixed regardless of how the price fluctuates.</p><h2>Bitcoin was designed to survive regulation and centralization</h2><p>Nvidia, a major computer chip and graphics card manufacturer, reached a 68-week low on Sept. 2 after U.S. officials imposed a new license requirement for the company's artificial intelligence chip exports to China and Russia. Meanwhile, in mid-2021, China <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/death-knell-for-chinese-crypto-miners-rigs-on-the-move-after-gov-t-crackdown/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/death-knell-for-chinese-crypto-miners-rigs-on-the-move-after-gov-t-crackdown"">cracked down on mining facilities</a> in the region, causing Bitcoin's hash rate to drop 50% in 2 months.</p><p>The main difference in both cases is Bitcoin's automated difficulty adjustment, which reduces the pressure on miners when there's less activity. While the U.S. regulation will likely impact Nvidia's exports, nothing is stopping Taiwanese TSMC chipmaker, South Korean Samsung or Chinese Huawei from growing and exporting products.</p><p>Bitcoin is a digital peer-to-peer electronic cash system, so it doesn't need centralized exchanges to survive. If governments opt to ban crypto trading completely, that would only emphasize the importance and strength of this decentralized network. Multiple countries have tried to suppress foreign currency from circulating, only to create a shadow market, with facilitators acting as illegal intermediaries.</p><p>Under the 3 different scenarios, varying from total blockage to a generalized bull market, odds favor Bitcoin against tech stocks at the current prices. Consequently, adjusted for its volatility, the risk reward strongly favors the cryptocurrency.</p><p><em>The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the </em><a href=""https://twitter.com/noshitcoins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>author</em></a><em> and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

'Crypto Biz: You can’t stop the Tether FUD ',"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 19:30:00 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-biz-you-can-t-stop-the-tether-fud,"""This week's Crypto Biz newsletter: The Wall Street Journal questions Tether's business model; venture capitalists are scooping up crypto at rock bottom prices.""","<div class=""post-content"" data-v-3511d6da=""""><p>In the world of crypto, FUD stands for fear, uncertainty and doubt. It’s often evoked intentionally to draw negative attention to a particular project or business. One of crypto’s most enduring legacies has been the constant FUD surrounding Tether, whose <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tether"">USDT</a> stablecoin commands a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. Whether intentional or not, The Wall Street Journal ran a story this week claiming that Tether was on the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/0-3-fall-in-assets-could-render-tether-technically-insolvent-wsj"">edge of technical insolvency</a> and that it wouldn’t take much to push the stablecoin issuer into financial peril. Of course, Tether didn’t take it lying down and immediately issued a response to what it considered to be a “disinformation” campaign by the Journal. </p><p>Regardless of which side of the debate you’re on, it’s becoming clear that there is a strong media bias against Tether. In fact, the Journal ran a story a few months ago claiming that more hedge funds were betting against the stablecoin around the same time that the crypto market as a whole was plunging. </p><p>This week’s Crypto Biz newsletter dissects the Tether controversy and gives you the latest information on the state of venture capital and <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world"">nonfungible tokens (NFTs)</a>.</p><h3>Tether responds to Wall Street Journal ‘disinformation’</h3><p>In an article published on Saturday, The Wall Street Journal claimed that even a 0.3% decline in Tether’s assets could deem the stablecoin issuer “technically insolvent.” The Journal was referring to Tether’s most recent disclosure on its website, which showed that <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/independent-tether-attestation-reveals-58-decrease-in-commercial-paper-holdings"">assets only narrowly exceeded its liabilities</a>. <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-responds-to-wall-street-journal-disinformation"">Tether clapped back</a> and accused the Journal of engaging in unnecessary FUD. “The article seeks to discredit the work that Tether has put into transparent and honest communication to the public,” Tether said. “Perhaps the WSJ has confused Tether with some of its competitors.” If you’re concerned about Tether FUD, don’t sweat it. The stablecoin issuer has been constantly attacked by mainstream media since at least 2017.</p><div class=""twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"" style=""display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" class="""" data-tweet-id=""1564354349677121536"" frameborder=""0"" id=""twitter-widget-0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=cointelegraph&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1564354349677121536&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fcrypto-biz-you-can-t-stop-the-tether-fud&amp;sessionId=dcff1a96c1ca1f225b9f087e9d5d33d06cc50dab&amp;siteScreenName=cointelegraph&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=1bfeb5c3714e8%3A1661975971032&amp;width=550px"" style=""position: absolute; visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;"" title=""Twitter Tweet""></iframe></div><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-twitter-extracted-i1662347145519522546=""true""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Lots of milking <a href=""https://t.co/ZBJnmvai9f"">pic.twitter.com/ZBJnmvai9f</a></p>— Paolo Ardoino  (@paoloardoino) <a href=""https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1564354349677121536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">August 29, 2022</a></blockquote>

<h3>‘Most of crypto is still junk’ and lacks use case — JPMorgan blockchain head</h3><p>After bashing Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) for years, JPMorgan has spun out a dedicated division for digital assets — a clear sign that the major banks acknowledge the sector’s long-term value proposition. Umar Farooq, who heads JPMorgan’s digital asset division, recently told a panel that <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/most-of-crypto-is-still-junk-and-lacks-use-case-jpmorgan-blockchain-head"">most crypto projects are “junk”</a> and not worth pursuing as investments. “I mean, with the exception of, I would say, a few dozen tokens, everything else that has been mentioned is either noise or, frankly, is just gonna go away,” he told the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Green Shots Seminar. I think most investors would agree that most crypto projects don’t have a future. The problem is agreeing on which projects outside of Bitcoin and Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) are not junk. </p><h3>Don’t miss it! Crypto market dump — Is it over or the start of the next mega crash?</h3><p>Crypto winter is starting to look like a crypto deep freeze as Bitcoin, Ether and altcoins all plunged this week.

'What would you ask Satoshi Nakamoto?

<p>One user brought up the topic of recovering lost Bitcoin. The Twitter user <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewsPg1/status/1565671423271735296"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that they would ask Nakamoto if there is any way to recover all those lost BTC. In a previous interview with Cointelegraph, Kim Grauer, an executive at analytics firm Chainalysis, said that <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/lost-bitcoin-may-be-a-donation-but-is-it-hindering-adoption/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/lost-bitcoin-may-be-a-donation-but-is-it-hindering-adoption"">around 3.7 million BTC</a>, worth $75 billion at the time of writing, has been lost.</p><p>Many believe that <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoin-really-a-hedge-against-inflation/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoin-really-a-hedge-against-inflation"">Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation</a> due to its inherent feature of having a limited supply. This may be why another response raised the issue of the public's understanding of money and scarcity. According to a community member, they would <a href=""https://twitter.com/sovereign_intel/status/1565670706444001280"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ask</a> Nakamoto if they had ever anticipated that the masses would have little understanding of financial concepts and scarcity, suggesting that if people understood, they would be all over Bitcoin and ditching inflationary currencies. </p><p>As the Twitter thread got more replies, the answers started to become more creative and dystopian. One user <a href=""https://twitter.com/MartSchmalzried/status/1565642845054189570"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> that they would ask Nakamoto if they are an artificial intelligence life form that teleported from the future to build a decentralized computing infrastructure and ""take control of humanity."" </p><p>Apart from these, one of the most asked questions revolved around asking for the Bitcoin founder’s private keys. After all, Nakamoto’s wallet is <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/109-billion-bitcoin-stash-proves-satoshi-is-still-the-biggest-whale/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/109-billion-bitcoin-stash-proves-satoshi-is-still-the-biggest-whale"">believed to have around 1.1 million BTC</a>, which is worth $22.5 billion at the current market price and was worth $77.6 billion at the currency’s all-time high. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/62-of-wallets-did-not-sell-bitcoin-for-a-year-amid-the-bear-market-data/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/62-of-wallets-did-not-sell-bitcoin-for-a-year-amid-the-bear-market-data""><strong><em>62% of wallets did not sell Bitcoin for a year amid the bear market: Data</em></strong></a></p><p>One of the most prominent crypto projects that followed Bitcoin's example is the smart contract platform Ethereum.

In July, Cointelegraph asked the community if they thought <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/will-ethereum-ever-surpass-bitcoin-crypto-community-answers/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-ethereum-ever-surpass-bitcoin-crypto-community-answers"">ETH has a chance ever to surpass BTC</a>.
