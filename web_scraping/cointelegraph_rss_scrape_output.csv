‘Far too easy’ — Crypto researcher’s fake Ponzi raises $100K in hours,"Tue, 06 Sep 2022 03:37:47 +0100",https://cointelegraph.com/news/far-too-easy-crypto-researcher-s-fake-ponzi-raises-100k-in-hours,"Crypto Twitter user FatManTerra explained the fake investment scheme was used to teach people a lesson about investing blindly in crypto schemes shilled by influencers.
","<div class=""post-content"" data-v-3511d6da=""""><p>Crypto influencer FatManTerra claims to have gathered over $100,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) from crypto investors in an investment scheme that was later revealed as fake. </p><p>The crypto researcher said he created the fake investment scheme as an experiment and to teach people a lesson about blindly following the investment advice of influencers. </p><p>The account on Twitter has around 101,100 followers and is mostly known for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-fallout-stablegains-lawsuit-hashed-loses-billions-finder-wrong-and-more"">being a former Terra proponent</a> that now actively <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/do-kwon-dismisses-allegation-of-cashing-out-2-7b-from-terra-luna-ust"">speaks out against the project</a> and founder Do Kwon following its $40 billion collapse in May. </p><p>In a Sept. 5 tweet, FatManTerra told his followers he had “received access to a high-yield BTC farm” by an unnamed fund, and said that people could message him if they wanted-in on the yield farming opportunity. </p><p>“I've maxed out what I could, so there's some leftover allocation and I thought I'd pass it along — priority will be given to UST victims. DM for more details if interested,” he wrote. </p><p>While the post received a ton of negative <a href=""https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1566764411230081025"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">responses</a> from people calling it out as a scam, FatMan said he still managed to raise more than $100,000 worth of BTC from the initial post on Twitter and on Discord within a span of two hours.</p><p>In a Sept. 6 tweet, FatManTerra revealed the investment scheme was fake all along, describing it as an “awareness campaign” to show how easy it is to dupe people in crypto by using simple buzzwords and promising big investment returns. </p><blockquote>“While I used plenty of buzzwords and put on a very convincing act on all platforms, I made sure to keep the investment details intentionally obscure — I didn't name the fund &amp; I didn't describe the trade — no one knew where the yield was coming from. But people still invested.”</blockquote><p>“I want to send a clear, strong message to everyone in the crypto world — anyone offering to hand you free money is lying. It simply doesn't exist. Your favorite influencer selling you quick money trading coaching or offering a golden investment opportunity is scamming you,” he added. </p><div class=""twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"" style=""display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" class="""" data-gtm-yt-inspected-7286441_727=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-7286441_728=""true"" data-tweet-id=""1566816038590767104"" frameborder=""0"" id=""twitter-widget-0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=cointelegraph&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1566816038590767104&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Ffar-too-easy-crypto-researcher-s-fake-ponzi-raises-100k-in-hours&amp;sessionId=75a4a90a40f6248d910f5e1a65365344ab3cec31&amp;siteScreenName=cointelegraph&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=1bfeb5c3714e8%3A1661975971032&amp;width=550px"" style=""position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 573px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;"" title=""Twitter Tweet""></iframe></div>

Ethereum gone wrong?

","<div class=""post-content"" data-v-3511d6da=""""><p>The assumption that Ethereum will just transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake (PoS) network after the <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/explained/will-the-ethereum-20-update-reduce-high-gas-fees/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/will-the-ethereum-20-update-reduce-high-gas-fees"">Merge</a> somewhat ignores the risk and effort necessary to move an asset that has a $193 billion market capitalization and 400 decentralized applications (DApps).</p><p>That is precisely why monitoring vital network conditions is essential for anyone willing to trade the event which is scheduled for Sept. 14, according to ethernodes.org. More importantly, traders should be prepared to detect any alarming developments in case things go wrong.</p><p>Apart from the $34.2 billion in total value locked in smart contracts, another $5.3 billion in Ether is staked on the Beacon Chain. The network is currently used by many tokens, oracle providers, stablecoins, layer-2 scalability solutions, synthetic assets, nonfungible items (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and cross-chain bridges. </p><p>This partially explains why the Merge has been postponed multiple times through the years and why it is deemed to be the most significant upgrade in the history of the network.</p><p>For this reason, three different testnets have undergone the Merge, with Goerli being the latest on Aug. 11. Curiously, <a data-amp=""https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sept-19-ethereum-merge-date-on-track-as-goerli-test-merge-successfully-finalized/amp"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/sept-19-ethereum-merge-date-on-track-as-goerli-test-merge-successfully-finalized"">minor issues were presented</a> on all testnet implementations, including Ropsten and Sepolia. For instance, Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden noted that “two different terminal blocks and lots of non-updated nodes” slightly slowed the process down.</p><h2>The core of any blockchain network are its blocks</h2><p>It doesn’t matter what the consensus mechanism is. All blockchains rely on new blocks being proposed and validated. There are established block parameters that must be followed even to be considered by the network participants.</p><p>In the case of the Ethereum Merge, an epoch is a bundle of up to 32 blocks that should be attested within six and a half minutes. Actively monitoring the ETH2 Beacon Chain Mainnet from reputable sources like <a href=""https://beaconscan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BeaconScan</a> by Etherscan and <a href=""https://ethscan.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ethscan</a> ETH2 Explorer by Redot is important.</p><figure><img pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-09/e0447d50-cf16-47fb-a848-e7e8cd98f7ea.png""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Ethereum Beacon Chain epochs and blocks. Source: EthScan</em></figcaption></figure><p>Red flags on this monitor would be low voting participation on the epochs, the lack of finality after thirteen minutes (2 epochs) or a grind halt on proposed blocks.</p><h2>Monitoring Infura’s Ethereum 2.0 API</h2><p>Infura provides infrastructure for building decentralized applications, allowing developers to deploy their solutions without hosting their own full Ethereum node.

Any validator deliberately misbehaving is slashed, meaning part of its respective 32 Ether stake is removed. Repetitive slashes will eventually cause the validator to be ejected from the network. Staking providers and the validator software have built-in protection to prevent someone from accidentally being slashed, for example, if their connection went down.</p><figure><img pinger-seen=""true"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-09/914ce420-331a-43d9-8119-32e56469c5f9.png""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Slashed validators info. Source: BeaconScan</em></figcaption></figure><p>Traders need to understand that slashing is a standard action of the network, a protective measure, so it should not immediately be deemed unfavorable. A worrisome environment would be hundreds of validators being slashed simultaneously, potentially indicating that their software is not functioning as it should.</p><p>There are over 410,000 active validators, so even if 20% or 30% of them eventually went offline, the network would continue as designed. Monitoring slashing is a preemptive measure because it likely indicates that some service, such as a hosting provider, has gone offline or some incompatibility arose during the Merge.</p><p>Ethereum advocates should consider monitoring external data instead of just their own node and server. There could be delays or even erroneous warning signs, so using multiple sources of information could help one avoid being misled by data from a single website or a post on social networks.</p><p><em>The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the </em><a href=""https://twitter.com/noshitcoins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>author</em></a><em> and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

<p>The Bitcoiner, who said they joined the space in 2011, claimed that they were “one of hundreds of thousands of OTC traders” in 2019 amid a bad actor involved in an illegal lottery scheme using the trading group to launder funds with Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) purchases. Rizzn claimed facilitating fiat-to-crypto exchanges on behalf of the party — who they hinted did not know was being investigated for a crime — resulted in being targeted by U.S. authorities:</p><blockquote>“I cooperated fully with the 15 armed FBI agents who raided my home in Oct of 2019. I wasn’t able to find a crypto-fluent attorney after I was raided in 2020 [...] I was told that if I plead to the 18 USC 1960 charge, any actions against my family would be dropped.”</blockquote><p>According to Rizzn, they were “fully registered as a Bitcoin seller with FinCEN” but the Justice Department still targeted them based on their involvement in the illicit transactions. Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/pr/doctor-bitcoin-pleads-guilty-illegal-cash-crypto-scheme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> at the time that Hopkins “ignored federal law and allowed fraudsters to use Bitcoin to operate under the radar of law enforcement” and did not take steps to verify the source of the funds involved in the transactions — between $550,000 and $1.5 million at the time. Rizzn has disputed many of the Justice Department's claims, saying that they performed the proper Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering practices.</p><p>“Here's the thing that makes this important to pay attention to and resolve: I'm a nobody,” <a href=""https://twitter.com/rizzn/status/1566555784879788033"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> Rizzn. </p><blockquote>“I'm not Ross.
